    "    - there are to many variables involved\n",

    "    model.\n",
    "14. Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular\n",

    "1. Can we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why\n",
    "    not?\n",
    "    - we take random samples, as long as the original data distribution is preserved, and dont train with them. Also, it depends.\n",
    "2. What is overfitting? Provide an example.\n",
    "    - when we test the model with test data, we get a significantly higher error, than with the training data, which means the model learnd the training data to well.\n",
    "3. What is a metric? How does it differ from “loss”?\n",
    "    - a metric is how you measure the success of the model, and the loss function is used to train the model.\n",
    "4. How can pretrained models help?\n",
    "    - some work has already been done, so if you need something similar to what the pretrained model does, you can use that model to improve upon it.\n",
